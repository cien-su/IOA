Programs and codes for Intelligent Optimization Algorithms in Python.

## Preface
It's widely known that Intelligent Optimization Algorithms can be divided into 4 categories:
    - Evolutionary Algorithms
    - Swarm-based Algorithms
    - Physics-based Algorithms
    - Others
This repository is for these kinds of codes and programs. Some explanations are as follows.

## Evolutionary Algorithms

## Swarm-based Algorithms

## Physics-based Algorithms
### Simulation Annealing
