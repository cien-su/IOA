# IOA
Programs and codes for Intelligent Optimization Algorithms in Python.

## Preface
It's widely known that Intelligent Optimization Algorithms can be divided into 4 categories and many sub-categories: 
- Evolutionary Algorithms
- Swarm-based Algorithms
- Physics-based Algorithms
    - Simulated Annealing Algorithm
    - Gravitational Search Algorithm 
- Others

This repository is for these kinds of codes and programs. All codes are programmed by Python 3.9.13.

Some explanations are given to help you use these Python codes in each folder.
