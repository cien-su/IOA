## Physics-based Algorithms
Physics-based Algorithms are inspired by physical laws and turn objective rules into algorithms. Representative algorithms are *Simulated Annealing*, *Gravitational Search Algorithm* and so on.

This folder contains different kinds of physics-based algorithms. Every sub-folder will give you an explanation to one specific algorithm.
